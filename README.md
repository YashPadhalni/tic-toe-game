# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game written in C++ that allows two players to play against each other. The game checks for wins, draws, and allows players to replay after the game ends.

## How to Play

1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
2. Players take turns to place their marks ('X' or 'O') on the grid.
3. The first player to get three marks in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) wins.
4. If all 9 positions are filled and no player has won, the game is declared a draw.
5. Players can choose to play again after the game ends.

## Features

- Two-player game with alternating turns.
- Displays the game board after each turn.
- Validates player input to ensure the move is within bounds and not on an already filled spot.
- Checks for winning conditions and displays the result (win or draw).
- Option to play multiple games in a row.

## Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler such as `g++` for Linux/MacOS, or any IDE that supports C++ for Windows (e.g., Code::Blocks, Visual Studio).
